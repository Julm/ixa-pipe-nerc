/**
 * Training NER based on Apache OpenNLP Machine Learning API for English. This
 * class creates a feature set based on the features activated in the
 * trainParams.txt properties file:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Window: specify left and right window lengths.
 * <li>TokenFeatures: tokens as features in a window length.
 * <li>TokenClassFeatures: token shape features in a window length.
 * <li>OutcomePriorFeatures: take into account previous outcomes.
 * <li>PreviousMapFeatures: add features based on tokens and previous decisions.
 * <li>SentenceFeatures: add beginning and end of sentence words.
 * <li>PrefixFeatures: first 4 characters in current token.
 * <li>SuffixFeatures: last 4 characters in current token.
 * <li>BigramClassFeatures: bigrams of tokens and token class.
 * <li>TrigramClassFeatures: trigrams of token and token class.
 * <li>FourgramClassFeatures: fourgrams of token and token class.
 * <li>FivegramClassFeatures: fivegrams of token and token class.
 * <li>CharNgramFeatures: character ngram features of current token.
 * <li>DictionaryFeatures: check if current token appears in some gazetteer.
 * <li>ClarkClusterFeatures: use the clustering class of a token as a feature.
 * <li>BrownClusterFeatures: use brown clusters as features for each feature containing a token.
 * <li>Word2VecClusterFeatures: use the word2vec clustering class of a token as a feature.
 * <ol>
